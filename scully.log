Folder "./scully" doesn't seem to contain custom plugins Deprecation Notice:
       ======================================================================
         From now on, the plugin that is being used to render a route is
         able to be changed by the user. You can do this by adding or
         enabling the plugin your scully.muehler-website.config.ts
         file. For your convenience, we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

         To disable this warning enable the plugin of your choice.
         for Puppeteer please add:
             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.muehler-website.config.ts file.

          When you get this warning while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer
          you need to set the defaultRouteRenderer to the name of your plugin.
          The defaultRouteRenderer is now set to 'routeRenderer'.
